# Lint and Style Your TypeScript Code with ESLint and Prettier : React App

Why linting your code is important?
Linting will checks out the code without executing it.

## ESLint ✍️

ESLint parses your code, analyses it, and runs linting rules. These rules may trigger warnings or errors to let you know if your code is right or wrong.

## Install Eslint:

### `npm install eslint eslint-plugin-react lint-staged --save-dev`

ESLint is highly configurable. Just add `.eslintrc.js `file at the root of your project, and then you can run ESLint on any files you want.
